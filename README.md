# Windows 11 Context Menu Switch Files
Windows 11 brings a brand new user interface with more focus on simplification. It provides a clean and fresh design yet familiar. Windows 11 is built from the ground up to be more user-friendly and touch-friendly. The most significant changes are visible in the Start menu, Context menus, Taskbar, Settings, and the File Explorer. 

One of the most subtle Windows 11 changes involves the new modern right-click or context menu for File Explorer and Desktop. The new minimalized context menu is designed to be more simple, touch-friendly, and prevent third-party applications from cluttering the menu with more options. It is still packed with the most frequently used options like Cut, Copy, Rename, Sort, Properties, and Delete.

Users can still access the legacy or classic context menu by clicking on the ‘Show more options’ option on the right-click menu.

Although the new context or right-click menu is simpler and cleaner, it is a bit confusing for a lot of users. Also, the basic options like copy, cut, rename and delete are now only icons, which makes it a bit difficult for average users to navigate. **This repo contains two regedit files that can get back to the old classic context menu of Windows 10 in Windows 11.**
